🎨 SceneToStory

SceneToStory is a creative AI-based project built around one simple thought — what if an image could tell its own story?
It aims to blend computer vision with imagination, turning a single picture into a short written story that captures emotion, context, and depth.

🌱 Project Overview

The journey begins when a user uploads an image.

The system first generates a caption describing what’s seen.

That caption then becomes the seed for a story — crafted by another model that builds meaning around it.

The result? A narrative born entirely from a scene.

🧩 Current Progress

The project flow is ready — image upload → caption → story → output.
Now the real work starts: setting up the structure, exploring suitable AI models, and designing a clean, beginner-friendly interface.

🚀 What’s Next

Build the basic foundation of the project

Experiment with caption-generation and story models

Develop an interactive web interface for users

Polish the overall flow and storytelling output

🎯 Vision

To create something that connects technology and creativity — where every picture has a voice, and every scene becomes a story worth reading.
