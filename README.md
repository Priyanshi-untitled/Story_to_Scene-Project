SceneToStory is a creative AI-based project built around one simple thought — *what if an image could tell its own story?*
It aims to blend computer vision with imagination, turning a single picture into a short written story that captures emotion, context, and depth.

🌱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄
The journey begins when a user uploads an image.
- The system first generates a caption describing what’s seen.
- That caption then becomes the seed for a story — crafted by another model that builds meaning around it.

The result? A narrative born entirely from a scene.

🧩 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀
The project flow is ready — image upload → caption → story → output.
Now the real work starts: setting up the structure, exploring suitable AI models, and designing a clean, beginner-friendly interface.

🚀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁
- Build the basic foundation of the project
- Experiment with caption-generation and story models
- Develop an interactive web interface for users
- Polish the overall flow and storytelling output

🎯 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻
To create something that connects technology and creativity — where every picture has a voice, and every scene becomes a story worth reading.
