🌌 SceneToStory — Turning Images into Imagination

SceneToStory is an AI-driven project designed to transform visual scenes into written stories. By combining computer vision and natural language processing, it interprets an image, generates a caption, and then expands that caption into a short narrative — bringing static visuals to life through storytelling.

🧠 Vision
To build a seamless creative pipeline where technology meets imagination — an AI that not only “sees” but also “feels” and “writes.”

🔄 Project Flow (Planned Architecture)
🖼️ Image Upload: User provides an image input.
🤖 Caption Generation: Model 1 analyzes the image and produces a descriptive caption.
✍️ Story Creation: Model 2 takes the caption and generates a short story around it.
📜 Output Display: The final story is displayed on an intuitive web interface.

🚧 Current Phase
The workflow design and functional roadmap are complete. Development has just begun — focusing on model selection, backend logic, and interface setup. The goal right now is to build a working MVP that demonstrates the full flow from image to story.

💡 Upcoming Tasks
1-Setting up a Streamlit or Flask-based interface
2-Integrating pre-trained captioning models
3-Experimenting with text-generation frameworks
4-Refining the user experience for smoother interaction

🎯 Long-Term Goal
To create a platform where every image — from a simple click to a complex scene — can narrate its own unique story, powered by AI creativity.
