🧠 Technologies & Skills for SceneToStory

-->This file outlines the tools, libraries, and concepts needed to build and run the SceneToStory project.
-->It combines elements of AI, NLP, and web development to convert an image into a meaningful story.

⚙️ Core Language
#Python — main programming language used throughout the project

🤖 AI & Machine Learning

#Hugging Face Transformers — to use pre-trained models for text and story generation
#Pipeline & Transformer Basics — understanding how to load, modify, and use models
#OpenCV (optional) — for handling or preprocessing images if required later

🌐 Web Development

#Streamlit — for building the interactive web interface
#Frontend Basics (HTML / CSS / JS) — for customizing UI elements if needed

🗂️ Project Setup & Tools

#VS Code — main environment for writing and running the code
#Git & GitHub — for version control and progress tracking
#Google Colab (initially explored) — earlier used for understanding Python workflows
#requirements.txt — to manage dependencies

🚀 Learning Goals

Learn how to integrate Streamlit with Hugging Face models
Understand pre-trained model pipelines for generating captions and stories
Build a complete AI-based storytelling web app
Maintain clear documentation and structured code

🧾 Note: This file will continue to evolve as new features and improvements are added.
