# 🧠 Technologies & Skills for SceneToStory

This file outlines the tools, libraries, and concepts needed to **build and run the SceneToStory project**.  
It combines elements of **AI, NLP, and web development** to turn an image into a meaningful story.

## ⚙️ Core Languages
- **Python** — main programming language  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — for building the web interface

---

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
- **OpenCV** — image handling and preprocessing  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** — model development or inference  
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** — for text and story generation  
- **NLP Fundamentals** — tokenization, prompt understanding, and text generation basics

---

## 🌐 Web Development
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** — to create the user interface  
- **Requests / FastAPI (optional)** — to handle backend communication  
- **Frontend Basics** — for simple, clean user experience

---

## 🗂️ Project Setup & Tools
- **Git & GitHub** — version control and collaboration  
- **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook** — development environment  
- **Virtual Environment (venv)** — manage dependencies  
- **requirements.txt** — list project dependencies

---

## 🚀 Learning Goals
- Understand how image captioning models function  
- Connect multiple AI models into one workflow  
- Build a working prototype with a web interface  
- Improve code structure and documentation practices
