Day 1 – Report

Work Done:
--Learned what Streamlit is and how it’s used.
--Explored how to run Python in Google Colab.
--Studied Hugging Face Transformers and how to use pre-trained models in Python.

Next Step:
Implement the image-captioning (BLIP) model in Colab.

Day 2 Progress Report 🧠

--Explored suitable libraries required for my project.
--Read documentation and resources to understand their usage.
--Deepened understanding of Streamlit and Hugging Face, as these are the main components used in my project.
--Gained better clarity on how both tools integrate for building the final model.
--Earlier, I thought of doing this project on Google Colab, but now I’m building it using VS Code.
